Hey there, stranger. I am Athanasios “Thanos” Theodoridis and I live in the quiet and beautiful city of [Thessaloniki, Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki).

I have an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from [University of Thessaly](http://www.inf.uth.gr/?lang=en) and a masters on Engineering Management from [International Hellenic University](http://www.econ.ihu.edu.gr/). I am also a proud alumni of [Anatolia College High School](http://www.anatolia.edu.gr/cms.jsp).

I have been professionally involved with software development since 2009, having developed various iOS and web applications and designed a dozen few others. My clients ranged from non-technical business people, to local startups, to TechStars-alumni companies in Sillicon Valley. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:at@atworks.gr?subject=Hello,%20send%20me%20some%20references) for references.

I feel very comfortable working with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) [based](http://expressjs.com/) [frameworks](http://sailsjs.org/#!/) in the back-end as well as with [MV*](https://angularjs.org/) [frameworks](http://emberjs.com/) in the front-end. My tests are usually [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) flavored and carry good [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html). On iOS, I made the leap to [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and never going [back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C). I also do some [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)-ing but always up for [heavy-lifting](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). In general, I am always up to date with the industry’s best practices and constantly in the look of optimizing my workflows. I thrive in competitive and challenging environments, have a sick attention to detail and can learn and adapt rapidly.

Born and raised in a highly entrepreneurial family, I’ve started a few startups and will probably start a few more. When not working with technology, you’ll find me hitting the slopes with my skis, exchanging tennis balls in a court or rocking some blues-rock on my guitar. In between, I’ll probably be reading some books or backtesting some strategies related to money instruments trading.

You can always ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/attheodo), [Email](mailto:at@atworks.gr?subject=Hello!) or [Skype](skype:theodoridis.thanos?chat), check out more around my career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/attheodo) or fork any of [my code on GitHub](https://github.com/attheodo).
