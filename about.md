Hey there! My name is Thanos. Athanasios “Thanos” Theodoridis to be precise. I live in the quiet and beautiful city of [Thessaloniki, Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki).

I have an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from [University of Thessaly](http://www.inf.uth.gr/?lang=en) and a masters on Engineering Management from [International Hellenic University](http://www.econ.ihu.edu.gr/). I am also a proud alumni of [Anatolia College High School](http://www.anatolia.edu.gr/cms.jsp).

I have been professionally involved with software development since 2009, having developed various iOS and web applications and designed a dozen others. My clients range from non-technical business people and local startups to well-funded companies in the Bay area serving Fortune 500 clients. My core mission is to help my clients increase their value in the modern, technology-driven world and help them bring their mobile and web strategies into life.

As a pragmatic technology consultant, I feel very comfortable working with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Connect-based](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) frameworks as well as [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) in the backend side. With over 7 years experience on the iOS platform and Cocoa frameworks I can tackle almost any kind of project targeting Apple platforms. I have worked with most of the native frameworks as well as with various popular libraries. I love clean and scalable architectures, favor established patterns and I am also a great fan of clean, small and re-usable components. I religulously endorse test-driven and agile development processes ensuring a healthy balance between engineering efforts and product, business and financial demands. Additionally, I've spent a great time analyzing business requirements, designing user interfaces to fulfill them and iterate upon them to optimize results. I always try to stay up to date with the industry's best practices and I am constantly in the look to enhance my knowledge base with the latest trends. I thrive in competitive cultures and challenging ventures, have a sick attention to details and I am always keen to lean and adapt rapidly. This exact multidisciplinary background makes me a great fit for product management and technical lead positions.

Born and raised in a highly entrepreneurial family, I’ve started a few startups and will probably start a few more. When not working with technology, you’ll find me hitting the slopes with my skis, exchanging tennis balls in a court or rocking some blues-rock on my guitar. In between, I’ll probably be reading some books or backtesting some strategies related to money instruments trading.

Finally, by tremendously valuing the power of communities I seek to always get involved in joint activities with like-minded people, attend meet-ups, speak publicly and share knowledge and experiences as well as mentor and nurture newcomers and junior people. I am an executive member of [SKGTech](http://skgtech.io), Thessaloniki's tech-community, through which me and the rest of the members are actively promoting the tech industry, organize events and actions as well as [international conferences](http://www.devitconf.org). I'am also co-organizing [CocoaHeads SKG](http://cocoaheadsskg.github.io) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo7SSmiSt0R9ab1beWsX4ZA) / [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/CocoaHeadsSKG)), the local all-things-Apple-dev get together and have been a regular speaker at [Thessaloniki Node.js Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/).
